
3. Write program to clear(0) bits CIS, CM2, CM1, CM0 in register “CMCON” if bits CHS3, CHS2, CHS1, CHS0 bits are set to 0x07
 in register “ADCON0”

Algorithms:
1.Inithialise the two reg. “CMCON” and “ADCON0”
2.check using if conditions the ADCON0 is equal to anding with the 28
3.cmcono is is equal to anding with 0xf0 
4. otherwise print the next statement
