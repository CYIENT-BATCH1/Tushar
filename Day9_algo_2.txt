8. I). Write program to set (1) bits CIS, C2OUT, C1OUT in register “CMCON” if bits CHS3, CHS2, CHS1 bits are set to 0x06 in register 
“ADCON0”

Algorithms:
1.Inithialise the two reg. “CMCON” and “ADCON0” and m is equal to 0x006
2.shift the value by 3 bit  and oring with adcono reg.
3. check if adcono is is equal to cmcono shifting with 7,6 and 3  
4. print the value of cmcono
