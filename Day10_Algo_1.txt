10. Write a function to store "G_Eng_EngineTemperature_uchar" and "G_Eng_EngineRpm_uint" into 
" G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[5u]" as shown below.

unsigned char G_Eng_EngineTemperature_uchar = 50u ;


unsigned int G_Eng_EngineRpm_uint = 1000u;


unsigned char G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[5u];




Algorihtms:
1.Initialise the array G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte and check the for loop of the five row as shown in fig
2. initialise function and set bit value as per hex value
2. take a functions and set value
