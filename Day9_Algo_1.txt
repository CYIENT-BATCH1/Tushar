
7. I). Set the register SSPSTAT value such a way that bit CKE, P and S bit are cleared (0), without disturbing the other bits.

II). Find out the value of UA, BF, SMP bits in SSPSTAT register if the value of the register is 0x55

Algorithms:
1.Initialise the SSPTAT register and read the values using bitwise operator
2.Shift the valus 6th and 3rd and 4th bit
3.SSPTAT reg. value given as per requirement is 0x55
4.Take a for loop and shift operator get the value of UA, BF, SMP bits in SSPTAT register.
