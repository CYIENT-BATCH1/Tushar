
  6. Set the register T0CON value such a way that bit TMR0ON and PSA bit are set (1), without disturbing the other bits.

II). Find out the value of T0PS2, T0PS1, T0PS0 bits in T0CON register if the value of the register is 0xF3


Algorithms:
1.Initialise the T0CON register and read the values using bitwise operator
2.Shift the valus 7th and 3rd bit
3.T0CON reg. value given as per requirement
4.Take a for loop for three time and get the value of T0PS2, T0PS1, T0PS0 bits in T0CON register.
