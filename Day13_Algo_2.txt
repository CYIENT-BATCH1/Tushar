
Requirement 2:

Along with the “Requirement 1”, The Sensor_Values are considered as malfunction/corrupted if data is either 0xFF, 0x00 continuously for 3 samples.

Output 1 : Print the time stamps where data is coming as malfunction/corrupted.

Output 2 : Delete the malfunction/corrupted data samples and write valid sensor values to new 2-dimension array “Sensor_Final_Vlaue[Timestamp_Value][ Sensor_Data]” and print them – timestamp and values


Algorithms:
1.initialise  the Time stamp and Sensor_Values and read the value in 2d array 
2.No. of samples compare the noise value and print that value and delete the countinuous noise sample as per requirement
3.only valid data is stored in new array Sensor_Final_Value
